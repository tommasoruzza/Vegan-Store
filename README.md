# Vegan-Store
In this project, I was responsible for developing customized software for a vegan store to streamline its operations, manage inventory, and enhance the overall customer experience. The primary objective was to create a user-friendly and efficient system that would meet the specific needs of the vegan store, from product management to sales tracking.
